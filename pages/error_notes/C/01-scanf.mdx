## C Error Notes

### Problems with `%c`
`scanf()` only takes the characters it needs from the buffer, but this can cause issues when using `%c`. Consider the following program. When `scanf()` reads an integer, it leaves behind a newline character (`'\n'`) in the input buffer. The next time `scanf()` is called with `%c`, it thinks this leftover `'\n'` is the input character. Because of this, the program never gets to read the tax status input from the buffer.

> **Buffer?** <br /> A buffer is like a temporary storage spot in a computer's memory. It holds data for a short time while it's being moved from one place to another.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int items;
    char status; // tax status g or p

    printf("Number of items : ");
    scanf("%d", &items);

    printf("Status : ");
    scanf("%c", &status);   // ERROR: assigns \n to variable 'status'
                            //        and will not pause for user input

    printf("%d items (%c)\n", items, status);

    return 0;
}
```

The above program produces the following output:
```c
Number of items : 25
Status : 25 items (
)
```

> Notice how the newline character (`'\n'`) (which was assigned to the tax status variable) places the closing parenthesis on a newline.

Method-1:
```c
scanf("%d", &items);
scanf("%c%c", &junk, &status); // store one character in junk first
```

Method-2:
```c
scanf("%d", &items);
scanf("%*c%c", &status);       // discard(ignore) one character first
```

Method-3:
```c
scanf("%d", &items);
scanf(" %c", &status);         // discard(ignore) all whitespace first
```

Method-4:
```c
scanf("%d%*c", &items);        // discard(ignore) newline ('\n')
scanf("%c", &status);
```

Method-5:
```c
scanf("%d", &items);
clear();                       // call a custom function to clear the buffer
scanf("%c", &status);
```
