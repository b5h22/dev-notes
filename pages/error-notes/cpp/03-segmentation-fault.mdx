## C++ Error Notes

### Segmentation Fault (Segmentation violation) error

#### Issue
Accessing memory that is not allocated or accessing memory outside the bounds of an allocated block.

#### Details
This error often occurs when dereferencing a null pointer or accessing an array index beyond its bounds. For example:

```cpp
int* ptr = nullptr;
*ptr = 10; // Dereferencing a null pointer

int arr[5];
arr[5] = 10; // Accessing memory outside the bounds of the array
```

#### Solution
To avoid segmentation faults, ensure pointers are properly initialized before use and verify array indices are within bounds before accessing elements.
