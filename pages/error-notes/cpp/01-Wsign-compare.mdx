## C++ Error Notes

### -Wsign-compare warning error

#### Issue
Comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions.

#### Details
The issue at each line is in the for loop where 'i < size'. Here, 'i' is an unsigned integer (size_t) while the expression 'size - 1' or 'size' could potentially be a signed integer.
```cpp

for (size_t i = 0; i < size - 1; i++) { ... }

for (size_t i = 0; i â€¹ size; i++) { ... }

```

#### Solution
To fix these warning errors, consider changing the type of 'size' to unsigned or use a type casting to ensure 'size' and 'i' are of the same type. Always remember to carefully handle the types of variables to avoid such mismatches.
