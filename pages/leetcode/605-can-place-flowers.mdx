# 605. Can Place Flowers

## Description
You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.

Given an integer array `flowerbed` containing `0`'s and `1`'s, where `0` means empty and `1` means not empty, and an integer `n`, return `true` if `n` new flowers can be planted in the `flowerbed` without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and `false` otherwise.

### Example 1:
```
  Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
  Output: true
```

### Example 2:
```
  Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
  Output: false
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 104`
- `flowerbed[i]` is `0` or `1`.
- There are no two adjacent flowers in `flowerbed`.
- `0 <= n <= flowerbed.length`

## My Solution
```js

var canPlaceFlowers = function(flowerbed, n) {
  let cnt = 0;
  // if there is only one plot and it is empty and n is 1
  if(flowerbed.length == 1 && flowerbed[0] === 0 && n === 1) {
      return true
  }

  for(let i = 0; i < flowerbed.length; i++) {
    // if the first plot is empty and the next plot is empty
    if(i === 0 && flowerbed[i] === 0 && flowerbed[i+1] === 0) {
        flowerbed[i] = 1;
        cnt++;
    // if the plot is empty and the previous plot is empty and the next plot is empty
    } else if (flowerbed[i] === 0 && flowerbed[i-1] === 0 && flowerbed[i+1] === 0) {
        flowerbed[i] = 1;
        cnt++
    // if the last plot is empty and the previous plot is empty
    } else if (i === flowerbed.length -1 && flowerbed[i] === 0 && flowerbed[i-1] === 0) {
        flowerbed[i] = 1;
        cnt++
    }
  }
  // if the count of new flowers is greater than or equal to n
  return cnt >= n;
};

```

## Solution from others
```js

var canPlaceFlowers = function(flowerbed, n) {
  let count = 0;
  for(let i = 0; i < flowerbed.length; i++) {
      if(flowerbed[i] === 0 && (i === 0 || flowerbed[i-1] === 0) 
        && (i === flowerbed.length - 1 || flowerbed[i+1] === 0)) {
          flowerbed[i] = 1;
          count++;
      }
  }
  return count >= n;
};

```

## Note
> In JavaScript, negative index is not allowed. It will return undefined. If you want to check the last element of an array, you can use `array[array.length - 1]` instead of `array[-1]`.
