# 11. Container With Most Water

## Description
You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `ith` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

### Example 1:
![leetcode-problem-11](../.././src/leetcode-problem-11.png)
```
  Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
  Output: 49
  Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```

### Example 2:
```
  Input: height = [1,1]
  Output: 1
```

### Constraints:
- `n == height.length`
- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 10^4`

## Solution from others
```js

// Solution using two pointers
/**
 * @param {number[]} height
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxArea = function(height) {
    let maxArea = 0;
    let left = 0; // leftmost bar graph
    let right = height.length -1; // rightmost bar graph
    while(left < right) {
      // Base * Height
      // need lower height because of the water will be overflowed
      let currArea = (right - left) * Math.min(height[left], height[right]); 
      maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, currArea);
      // maintain the side with the greater height and move the lower side by one step
      if(height[left] < height[right]) {
          left++;
      } else {
          right--;
      }
    }
    return maxArea;
};

```
