## Memory
The memory available to an application at run-time consists of static memory and dynamic memory

### Static Memory
- The memory that the operating system allocates for the application at load time is called static memory.
- Static memory lasts the lifetime of the application
- The linker determines the amount of static memory used by the application

### Dynamic Memory
- The operating system provides dynamic memory to an application at run-time upon request
- Dynamic memory is allocated on the heap (a region of memory that is not managed by the operating system)

### lifetime
- The lifetime of dynamic memory is determined by the application
- The application is responsible for releasing the memory when it is no longer needed
- If the application fails to release the memory, it results in a memory leak

<br />

## Dynamic Memory Allocation/Deallocation
- The `new` operator is used to allocate memory on the heap
- The `delete` operator is used to release memory allocated by `new`
- The address of the allocated memory is stored in a pointer variable (static memory)
- Allocated memory must be deallocated within the scope of the pointer that holds its address

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // allocate memory for an integer
    int* p = new int;
    *p = 10;
    cout << *p << endl;

    // release memory
    delete p;

    return 0;
}
```

<br />

### Memory Leaks
- A memory leak occurs when the application fails to deallocate memory that is no longer needed
    - The pointer to dynamic memory goes out of scope before the application deallocates that memory
    - The pointer to dynamic memory changes its value before the application deallocates the memory starting at the address stored in that pointer
