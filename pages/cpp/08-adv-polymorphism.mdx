# Advanced Polymorphism

## Generalization and Specialization
- Achieved through interfaces and virtual functions, allowing different classes to be treated as instances of the same base class, particularly when implementing type-specific behavior.
  
```cpp
class Animal {
public:
    virtual void makeSound() {
        cout << "Some generic sound" << endl;
    }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void makeSound() override {
        cout << "Bark" << endl;
    }
};

class Cat : public Animal {
public:
    void makeSound() override {
        cout << "Meow" << endl;
    }
};

// Usage
Animal* a1 = new Dog();
Animal* a2 = new Cat();
a1->makeSound();  // Outputs: Bark
a2->makeSound();  // Outputs: Meow
```
> This example shows how polymorphism allows objects of different classes (`Dog` and `Cat`) to be treated as instances of the same base class (`Animal`). The `makeSound` function is overridden in each derived class to provide type-specific behavior.


## Inclusion Polymorphism
- **Inclusion Polymorphism**: Also known as runtime polymorphism, it allows objects of derived classes to be treated as objects of the base class, enabling dynamic binding of functions at runtime.
- **implementatopm**: Typically achieved through inheritance and virtual functions, allowing for code flexibility and extensibility.
- **Polymorphic Objects**: Objects can exhibit different behaviors when accessed through base class pointers or references, depending on their actual derived type.
- **Dynamic Binding**: The function to be called is determined at runtime based on the actual type of the object, not the type of the pointer or reference used to access it.

```cpp
  class Animal {
public:
    virtual void speak() {
        cout << "Animal speaks" << endl;
    }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void speak() override {
        cout << "Dog barks" << endl;
    }
};

// Usage
Animal* a = new Dog();
a->speak();  // Outputs: Dog barks (dynamic type is Dog)
```
> Here, the dynamic type of the object `a` is determined at runtime. Although `a` is a pointer to `Animal`, it points to a `Dog` object, so the `Dog`'s `speak` function is called, demonstrating inclusion polymorphism.


## Copying Polymorphic Objects
- **Clone Function**: To copy a polymorphic object, a `clone()` function is added to the abstract base class, allowing each derived class to define its specific cloning behavior.
- **Implementatio**: The `clone()` function returns a pointer to a new object of the same derived type, enabling polymorphic copying.

```cpp
  class Shape {
public:
    virtual Shape* clone() const = 0;
    virtual void draw() = 0;
};

class Cube : public Shape {
public:
    Cube* clone() const override {
        return new Cube(*this); // Use copy constructor
    }
    void draw() override {
        cout << "Drawing a Cube" << endl;
    }
};

class Sphere : public Shape {
public:
    Sphere* clone() const override {
        return new Sphere(*this);
    }
    void draw() override {
        cout << "Drawing a Sphere" << endl;
    }
};

// Usage
Shape* original = new Cube();
Shape* copy = original->clone();
copy->draw();  // Outputs: Drawing a Cube
```
> The clon`e function allows for the copying of polymorphic objects. In this example, the `Cube` class overrides the `clone` function to return a new instance of itself using the copy constructor, demonstrating how each derived class can implement specific cloning behavior.


## Specializing Operations with Dynamic Types
- **Dynamic Casting**: Used to safely downcast a base class pointer to a derived class type, enabling type-specific operations.
- **`dynamic_cast`**: Performs a runtime check to ensure the cast is valid, returning a null pointer if the cast fails.
- **Operator Overloading**: Allows for type-specific behavior based on the dynamic type of the object.

```cpp
class Shape {
public:
    virtual bool operator==(const Shape& other) const = 0;
};

class Cube : public Shape {
private:
    double side;
public:
    Cube(double s) : side(s) {}
    bool operator==(const Shape& other) const override {
        const Cube* c = dynamic_cast<const Cube*>(&other);
        return c && this->side == c->side;
    }
};

// Usage
Cube c1(3.0), c2(3.0), c3(4.0);
cout << (c1 == c2);  // Outputs: 1 (true)
cout << (c1 == c3);  // Outputs: 0 (false)
```
> The `operator==` is overloaded in the `Cube` class to compare `Cube` objects based on their `side` length. The `dynamic_cast` ensures that the comparison only occurs if both objects are of the `Cube` type, demonstrating how dynamic typing can be used to specialize operations.


## Dynamic Type Identification
- **Run-Time Type Information (RTTI)**: `typeid` and `dynamic_cast` allow for run-time identification and manipulation of an objectâ€™s dynamic type.
- **`typeid` Operator**: Used to determine the dynamic type of an object at runtime, returning a `type_info` object that can be compared with other types.

```cpp
class Shape {
public:
    virtual void show() const {
        if (typeid(*this) == typeid(Cube)) {
            cout << "This is a Cube" << endl;
        } else if (typeid(*this) == typeid(Sphere)) {
            cout << "This is a Sphere" << endl;
        }
    }
};

class Cube : public Shape { /*...*/ };
class Sphere : public Shape { /*...*/ };

// Usage
Shape* s = new Cube();
s->show();  // Outputs: This is a Cube
```
> The `show` function uses `typeid` to check the dynamic type of the object at runtime. Depending on the type, it outputs whether the object is a `Cube` or a `Sphere`, demonstrating how RTTI can be used to identify and handle objects based on their actual type.
