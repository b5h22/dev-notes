# Template

## Basic Concepts and Syntax

### Polymorphism in C++
- **Polymorphism**: It is the ability to use a single interface to represent different data types or classes. In C++, polymorphism can be achieved through function overloading, operator overloading, and inheritance.
- There are two types of polymorphism: compile-time (static) and runtime (dynamic):
  - **Compile-time Polymorphism**: Also known as static polymorphism, it is resolved during compile time. It is achieved through function overloading, operator overloading, and templates.
  - **Runtime Polymorphism**: Also known as dynamic polymorphism, it is resolved during runtime. It is achieved through inheritance and virtual functions.
- **Template**: A `template` is a blueprint or formula for creating a generic class or function. It allows the creation of functions and classes that can operate with any data type.

### Template Syntax
- Templates begin with the `template` keyword, followed by template parameter lists enclosed in angle brackets (`<>`).
- Template parameter list: Specifies the types or values that can be used to instantiate the template.
```cpp
template <typename T, int N>
class MyClass {
  // Class implementation
};
```
