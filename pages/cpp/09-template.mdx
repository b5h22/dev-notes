# Template

## Basic Concepts and Syntax

### Polymorphism in C++
- **Polymorphism**: It is the ability to use a single interface to represent different data types or classes. In C++, polymorphism can be achieved through function overloading, operator overloading, and inheritance.
- There are two types of polymorphism: compile-time (static) and runtime (dynamic):
  - **Compile-time Polymorphism**: Also known as static polymorphism, it is resolved during compile time. It is achieved through function overloading, operator overloading, and templates.
  - **Runtime Polymorphism**: Also known as dynamic polymorphism, it is resolved during runtime. It is achieved through inheritance and virtual functions.
- **Template**: A `template` is a blueprint or formula for creating a generic class or function. It allows the creation of functions and classes that can operate with any data type.

### Template Syntax
- Templates begin with the `template` keyword, followed by template parameter lists enclosed in angle brackets (`<>`).
- Template parameter list: Specifies the types or values that can be used to instantiate the template.
```cpp
template <typename T, int N>
class MyClass {
  // Class implementation
};
```

<br />

### Template Body
- The template body is defined using placeholders that are replaced during instantiation with actual arguments.
- The placeholders are specified using the `typename` keyword for types and other keywords like `class`, `int`, etc., for non-type parameters.
```cpp
template <typename T>
void print(T value) {
    std::cout << value << std::endl;
}
```
> The placeholder `T` is replaced by the actual type (like `int`, `float`) when the function is called.

### Model Polymorphic Behavior Using Templates (Generics)
- Templates in C++ allow you to write generic and reusable code that can handle different data types without duplication. This is known as parametric polymorphism.
```cpp
template <typename T>
T add(T a, T b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    std::cout << add(3, 4) << std::endl; // Works with int
    std::cout << add(3.5, 2.1) << std::endl; // Works with double
}
```
> The `add` function can work with different data types (`int`, `double`, etc.) without the need for separate implementations.
