### Structured programming
Structured programming is a way of writing code that focuses on making it easy to read and change. It breaks down a program into smaller parts using functions and blocks. It uses three main parts: sequence, selection, and repetition. The aim is to make the code simple and manageable.

- Sequence: This is the normal flow where statements are executed line by line in order.
- Selection: This is implemented with control statements like "if", "if-else", and "switch". It allows the program to choose between different paths based on certain conditions.
- Repetition: This is implemented with loops like "for", "while", and "do-while". It allows certain parts of the code to be repeated several times.
