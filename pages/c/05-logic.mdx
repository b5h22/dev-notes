### Structured programming
Structured programming is a way of writing code that focuses on making it easy to read and change. It breaks down a program into smaller parts using functions and blocks. It uses three main parts: sequence, selection, and repetition. The aim is to make the code simple and manageable.

<br />

- Sequence: This is the normal flow where statements are executed line by line in order.
- Selection: This is implemented with control statements like "if", "if-else", and "switch". It allows the program to choose between different paths based on certain conditions.
- Repetition: This is implemented with loops like "for", "while", and "do-while". It allows certain parts of the code to be repeated several times.

### Preliminary Design
Preliminary Design is the early stage of designing where you create a basic plan of what you want to make, without all the small details.

- Pseudocode: It's like a draft of your program, written in simple English. It helps you plan the steps your program will take, without using real code.
- Flowcharts: These are pictures with symbols and arrows that show the steps and flow of your program. They help you see and share your plan before you start coding.
