## Simple Calculation

### Format
| Type        | Specifier | intput/output as      |
|-------------|-----------|-----------------------|
| char        | `%c`      | character             | 
| int,short   | `%d`      | decimal integer       |
| float       | `%f`      | floating-point        |
| double      | `%lf`     | floating-point        |
- The default number of decimal places displayed by `%f` and `%lf` is 6. To display two decimal places, we write `%.2f` or `%.2lf`.

### Simple input
The `scanf(...)` command takes in information from the user and keeps it in a special place in the computer's memory linked to a certain variable in the program.
```c
scanf(format, address);
```
- address: contains the address of the destination variable. use the prefix `&` to refer to the 'address of' of a variable.

### Simple output
The `printf(...)` command shows the user the value of a certain variable or result of an operation.
```c
printf(format, expression);
```
