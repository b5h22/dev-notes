## Structures
The purpose of a structure in C programming is to allow programmers to define custom data types by grouping together various data types under one name. This allows for the creation of more complex data structures that can hold different types of data. Structures provide a way to organize and manage related data efficiently.

### Declaration
```c
struct Tag
{
    [type] [identifier];
    // ... other types
};
```
- `struct` keyword is used to declare a structure.
- `Tag` is the name of the structure.
- Inside the curly braces {} you list the types of data that will be in your structure. Each data type in the structure is called a "member" or "field".
- `type` is the data type of the member. It can be any valid C data type, like int, float, or even other structures.
- `identifier` is the name of the member that you will use to access the member's value.

### Initialization
To set up a new structure variable with starting values in C, we use braces {} with a list of values inside. These values are separated by commas and must be in the same order as the members in the structure. This is how we do it:
```c
struct Tag identifier = { value, ... , value };
```

### Member Acces
To access a member of an object of a structure, we use the dot operator (`.`). Dot notation takes the form:
```c
object.member
```
To access an element of an array member, we use subscript notation
```c
object.member[index]
```
