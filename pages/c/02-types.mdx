## Types
### Arithmetic Types (Size, Range, Type Specifier)
| Data Type | Size (in bytes) | Range                                         | Type Specifier |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------|
| char      | 1               | -128 to 127 or 0 to 255                       | `%c`           |
| int       | 4               | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647               | `%d`           |
| float     | 4               | approximately 6 decimal digits of precision   | `%f`           |
| double   	| 8              	| approximately 15 decimal digits of precision 	| `%lf`          |

### Variable
- Declare variable
```c
// [type] [variable name];
int age; // declares an integer variable named 'age'
float weight; // declares a float variable named 'weight'
char firstLetter; // declares a character variable named 'firstLetter'
```
- Once declared, you can assign values to these variables like this:
```c
age = 20; // assigns the value 20 to 'age'
weight = 70.5; // assigns the value 70.5 to 'weight'
firstLetter = 'A'; // assigns the character A to 'firstLetter'
```
- You can also declare and assign values at the same time:
```c
int age = 20;
float weight = 70.5;
char firstLetter = 'A';
```
- You may group the identifiers of variables that share the same type within a single declaration by separating the identifiers by commas.
```c
 char   children, digit;
 int    nPages = 10, nBooks = 3, nRooms = 1;
 float  cashFare, height = 185.5, weight = 70.5;
 double loan, mortgage;
```
- You can use `const` keyword to declare a constant. A constant is a type of variable whose value cannot be changed after it's been defined.
```c
const int myConstant = 10;
```

### Naming Conventions
- Start with a letter or an underscore (_).
- Use any mix of letters, numbers, and underscores (_).
- Keep it under 32 characters long.
- Don't use C reserved words

### Tips for good variable names
- Make the name explain what it's used for.
- Keep it short but clear.
- Make sure the name matches what data is stored in it.
- The name should make your code easier to read.
- Use "camelNotation" where the first letter of each word is capitalized except the first word (like "myVariableName").
- Avoid using underscores (_) because system libraries often use them and you don't want to mix up your variables with theirs.
