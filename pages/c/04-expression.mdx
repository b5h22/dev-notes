## Expression

### Binary Operations

Binary arithmetic operations are math actions we can do on whole numbers. These include adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing and finding the remainder.

| **Arithmetic Expression** | **Meaning**                                |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| operand `+` operand         | add the operands                           |
| operand `-` operand         | subtract the right from the left operand   |
| operand `*` operand         | multiply the operands                      |
| operand `/` operand         | divide the left by the right operand       |
| operand `%` operand         | remainder of the division of left by right |

### Relational Expressions

C language has six ways to compare things. These comparisons are called relational expressions. They look at two values and decide if a condition is true or not. If it's **_true_**, they give back **_1_**; if it's **_false_**, they give back **_0_**. The result you get from these comparisons is always an `int` type.

| **Relational Expression** | **Meaning**                                |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| operand `==` operand      | operands are equal                         |
| operand `>` operand       | left is greater than the right             |
| operand `>=` operand      | left is greater than or equal to the right |
| operand `<` operand       | left is less than the right                |
| operand `<=` operand      | left is less than or equal to the right    |
| operand `!=` operand      | left is not equal to the right             |

### Logical Expressions

C language doesn't have special words for true or false. Instead, it sees the number **_0_** as **_false_** and any **_other number_** as **_true_**. C has three ways to do logical operations. These operations give back **_1_** if they are **_true_** and **_0_** if they are **_false_**. The result you get from these operations is always an `int` type.

| **Logical Expression**     | Meaning                     |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| operand `&&` operand       | both operands are true      |
| operand `\|\|` operand     | one of the operands is true |
| `!` operand                | the operand is not true     |
