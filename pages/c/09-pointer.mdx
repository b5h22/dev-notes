## Pointers

### What is a pointer?
- A pointer is a variable that stores the address of another variable.
- It is used to store the memory address of a variable.

<br />

### Why use pointers?
- To access the memory address of a variable.
- To access the value of a variable indirectly.
- To pass arguments by reference.
- To return multiple values from a function.
- To allocate memory dynamically.

<br />

### Pointer Declaration
- The declaration of a pointer is similar to the declaration of a variable.
- The data type of a pointer must be the same as the data type of the variable it points to.
- The pointer declaration is done by adding an asterisk (*) before the pointer name.

```c
int *ptr;
```

<br />

### Pointer Initialization
- A pointer can be initialized with the address of a variable.
- The address of a variable can be obtained by using the address-of operator (&).

```c
int num = 10;
int *ptr = &num;
```

<br />

### Pointer Dereferencing
- Dereferencing a pointer means accessing the value of the variable it points to.
- The value of a variable can be accessed by using the dereference operator (*).

```c
int num = 10;
int *ptr = &num;
printf("%d", *ptr); // Output: 10
```

<br />

### Pointer Arithmetic
- Pointer arithmetic is used to perform arithmetic operations on pointers.
- The arithmetic operations include addition, subtraction, increment, and decrement.
- The size of the data type is taken into account when performing arithmetic operations.

```c
int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int *ptr = arr;
printf("%d", *ptr); // Output: 1
ptr++;
printf("%d", *ptr); // Output: 2
```

<br />

### Pass-by-value
- In C, arguments are passed to functions by value.
- It means that a copy of the data is made and used inside the function, not affecting the original data.

```c
void increment(int num){
  num++;
}

int num = 10;
increment(num);
printf("%d", num); // Output: 10
```

<br />

### Pass-by-reference
- Pointers can be passed as arguments to functions.
- Passing a pointer as an argument allows the function to modify the value of the variable it points to.

```c
void increment(int *ptr){
    (*ptr)++;
}

int num = 10;
increment(&num);
printf("%d", num); // Output: 11
```

<br />

### Pointer to Array
- A pointer to an array is a pointer that stores the address of the first element of an array.
- It is used to access the elements of an array using pointer arithmetic.

```c
int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int *ptr = arr;
printf("%d", *ptr); // Output: 1
ptr++;
printf("%d", *ptr); // Output: 2
```

<br />

### Pointer to Structure
- A pointer to a structure is a pointer that stores the address of a structure.
- It is used to access the members of a structure using the arrow operator (->).

```c
struct Point{
    int x;
    int y;
};

struct Point p = {10, 20};
struct Point *ptr = &p;
printf("%d", ptr->x); // Output: 10
printf("%d", ptr->y); // Output: 20
```

<br />

### Null Pointer
- A null pointer is a pointer that does not point to any memory location.
- It is used to indicate that the pointer is not pointing to a valid memory address.
- It is represented by the constant NULL.

```c
int *ptr = NULL;
if(ptr == NULL){
    printf("Null Pointer");
}
```
