## Function

### Modular Design
A design method that divides a system into smaller parts (modules) which can be independently created and then fit together.
Some general guidelines for defining a module include:
- The module is easy to upgrade.
- The module contains a readable amount of code.
- The module may be used as part of the solution to some other problem.
- For a structured design, we stipulate that each module has one entry point and one exit point, each module is highly cohesive, and each module exhibits low coupling.

#### Cohesion
It refers to how closely all the routines in a module support a central purpose. High cohesion means each module has a single, well-defined task.

#### Coupling
It refers to the interdependence between modules. Loose coupling means each module is independent as much as possible.

> A better design is one that has high cohesion (each module does one thing well) and loose coupling (each module is independent).

### Functions
#### Definition
A function in C is a block of code that performs a specific task. It is the building block of modular programming.

#### Basic Syntax
- Function Definition: It includes the function's name, return type and parameters.
```c
// function declaration
return_type function_name(parameter1, parameter2, ...){
    // code
    return value;
}
```

- Function Call: It includes the function's name and arguments.
```c
// function call
function_name(argument1, argument2, ...);
```

#### Pass by Value
In C, arguments are passed to functions by value. It means that a copy of the data is made and used inside the function, not affecting the original data.

#### Type Mismatch in Arguments and Parameters
If the type of an argument does not match the type of the corresponding parameter in the function definition, the C compiler will try to convert the argument to the type of the parameter. If this is not possible, an error will occur.
