# Object Oriented JavaScript
- JavaScript is an object-oriented language, modeling systems as collections of objects with functions and data.

## Object Literal Notation​
- Object Literal Notation provides a simple way to create objects in JavaScript, defining their properties and methods in a concise syntax. It is a commonly used approach for creating standalone objects.
```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  fullName() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  }
};

console.log(person.fullName()); // Output: John Doe
```
> `person` is an object created using Object Literal Notation. It defines properties like `firstName` and `lastName`, along with a method `fullName()` to concatenate them.

<br />

## The 'Class' Keyword​
- The `class` keyword in JavaScript simplifies the creation of multiple objects with shared properties and methods. It promotes code organization and reusability, making it easier to manage and maintain complex codebases.
  
```javascript
class Car {
  constructor(make, model) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
  }

  displayInfo() {
    console.log(`Make: ${this.make}, Model: ${this.model}`);
  }
}

const car1 = new Car("Toyota", "Camry");
const car2 = new Car("Ford", "Mustang");

car1.displayInfo(); // Output: Make: Toyota, Model: Camry
car2.displayInfo(); // Output: Make: Ford, Model: Mustang
```
> `Car` is a class created using the `class` keyword. It defines a constructor and a method to display car information, promoting code organization and reusability.

<br />

### Private Methods / Properties​
- Private properties and methods in JavaScript can be marked with a `#` symbol, ensuring encapsulation and preventing direct access. This helps maintain data integrity and reduces potential conflicts with other parts of the code.

```javascript
class Person {
  #name;

  constructor(name) {
    this.#name = name;
  }

  getName() {
    return this.#name;
  }
}

const person = new Person("John");
console.log(person.getName()); // Output: John
console.log(person.#name); // Error: Private field '#name' must be declared in an enclosing class
```
> `#name` is a private property in the `Person` class. It cannot be accessed directly from outside the class, ensuring data privacy and integrity.

<br />

### Getters / Setters
- Getters and setters provide a way to control the access and manipulation of object properties. This allows for additional logic to be implemented when setting or getting values, such as validation or formatting.

```javascript
class Temperature {
  #celsius;

  constructor(celsius) {
    this.#celsius = celsius;
  }

  get fahrenheit() {
    return (this.#celsius * 9/5) + 32;
  }

  set fahrenheit(value) {
    this.#celsius = (value - 32) * 5/9;
  }
}

const temp = new Temperature(25);
console.log(temp.fahrenheit); // Output: 77
temp.fahrenheit = 32;
console.log(temp.fahrenheit); // Output: 89.6
```
> `fahrenheit` is a getter/setter property in the `Temperature` class. It converts temperature values between Celsius and Fahrenheit, providing controlled access to temperature data.

<br />

### Understanding "this"
- Proper understanding and usage of the "this" keyword is essential in object-oriented JavaScript. It refers to the current execution context and allows for accessing the correct object properties within methods.

```javascript
class Counter {
  constructor() {
    this.count = 0;
  }

  increment() {
    this.count++;
  }

  getCount() {
    return this.count;
  }
}

const counter = new Counter();
counter.increment();
console.log(counter.getCount()); // Output: 1
```
> The `increment()` method increases the `count` property of the `Counter` class. The `this` keyword ensures that `count` refers to the property of the current `Counter` instance.

<br />

### Inheritance
- Inheritance in JavaScript is achieved through the `extend` keyword, creating a prototype chain between classes. This allows for the reuse of code and the creation of hierarchies of related objects.

```javascript
class Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log("Animal makes a sound");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log("Dog barks");
  }
}

const dog = new Dog();
dog.speak(); // Output: Dog barks
```
> The `Dog` class inherits the `speak()` method from the `Animal` class. This enables instances of `Dog` to use the `speak()` method, promoting code reuse and hierarchy.

<br />

### Encapsulation and data hiding
- Encapsulation and data hiding are important concepts in object-oriented programming. By marking properties and methods as private, developers can control access and prevent unintended modifications, enhancing code security and maintainability.

```javascript
class BankAccount {
  #balance;

  constructor(initialBalance) {
    this.#balance = initialBalance;
  }

  deposit(amount) {
    this.#balance += amount;
  }

  withdraw(amount) {
    if (amount <= this.#balance) {
      this.#balance -= amount;
    } else {
      console.log("Insufficient funds");
    }
  }

  getBalance() {
    return this.#balance;
  }
}

const account = new BankAccount(1000);
account.deposit(500);
account.withdraw(200);
console.log(account.getBalance()); // Output: 1300
```
> `BankAccount` class encapsulates balance information with `#balance`. Methods like `deposit()` and `withdraw()` provide controlled access to modify the balance, ensuring data security and integrity.
