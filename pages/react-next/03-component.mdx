# React Component

## What is a React Component?
- A React component is a reusable piece of UI that can be composed together to create complex user interfaces.
- Components can be functional or class-based and are written in JSX (a syntax extension for JavaScript).
- Components can have props (properties) and state to manage data and UI interactions.

## Component Basics
### Functional Components
- Components in React are typically written as functions. These components return JSX to render UI elements.
  - Example:
    ```jsx
    export default function Home() {
      return <p>Welcome to Home!</p>;
    }
    ```

### Class Components
- Class components are ES6 classes that extend `React.Component`. They have a `render()` method that returns JSX.
  - Example:
    ```jsx
    import React from 'react';

    class Home extends React.Component {
      render() {
        return <p>Welcome to Home!</p>;
      }
    }

    export default Home;
    ```

### JSX
- JavaScript XML (JSX) allows you to write HTML-like syntax within JavaScript. Every return statement in JSX must return a single parent element, which can be wrapped in tags like `<div>` or empty fragments (`<>...</>`).
- JSX expressions can include JavaScript expressions within curly braces `{}`. This allows dynamic rendering of values like variables and function results.
  - Example:
    ```jsx
    export default function Home() {
      const name = 'John';
      return <p>Welcome, {name}!</p>;
    }
    ```

## Importing and Using Components
- Import Statements: React components and other resources (like images, fonts, and styles) are imported into the component files using `import` statements.
  - Example:
    ```jsx
    import React from 'react';
    import Header from './Header';
    import './styles.css';
    ```
- Using Functional Components: To render a component, you include it in JSX using self-closing tags like `<Home />` or regular tags like `<Home></Home>`.
  - Example:
    ```jsx
    import Home from './Home';

    export default function App() {
      return (
        <>
          <Header />
          <Home />
        </>
      );
    }
    ```

## props
- Components can accept inputs called "props" (short for properties), which are passed as attributes. Props are read-only and can be used to customize the behavior or display of a component.
  - Example:
    ```jsx
    export default function Hello({ fName, lName }) {
      return <p>Hello {fName} {lName}!</p>;
    }
    
    // Usage
    <Hello fName="John" lName="Doe" />
    ```

## State and Hooks
- State(useState): Components can have internal state managed by the `useState` hook. State allows components to manage dynamic data and re-render when the state changes.
  - Example:
    ```jsx
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Clicked {count} times</button>;
    ```
- useEffect: The `useEffect` hook is used to perform side effects in functional components. It runs after every render and can be used for data fetching, subscriptions, and DOM manipulations.
  - Example:
    ```jsx
    useEffect(() => {
      const timer = setInterval(() => setCount(c => c + 1), 1000);
      return () => clearInterval(timer);  // Cleanup
    }, []);
    ```
    > - The empty dependency array `[]` ensures that the effect runs only once after the initial render.
    > - You can clean up side effects using the return function inside useEffect.
    > - If you want the effect to run whenever a specific value changes, include that value in the dependency array.

## Fragments and Empty Elements
- JSX Fragments: You can use empty fragments (`<>...</>`) to avoid creating unnecessary wrapper elements in the DOM.
  - Example:
    ```jsx
    return (
      <>
        <Header />
        <Main />
        <Footer />
      </>
    );
    ```
- Empty Elements: Self-closing tags like `<img />` and `<input />` are used for elements without children. They don't require a closing tag.
  - Example:
    ```jsx
    return <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image" />;
    ```
