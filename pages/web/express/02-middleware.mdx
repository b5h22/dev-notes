# Middleware in Express.js
Middleware in Express refers to functions that execute in the ‘middle’ of a request/response cycle, typically before a matching route handler function is executed. Middleware functions have access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the `next()` function in the application's request-response cycle.

By implementing middleware, we can:

- Modify the `req` (request) or `res` (response) objects before processing the route.
- Redirect users or respond to requests before other routes are processed.
- Block clients from accessing specific routes.
- Log requests or handle logic before processing routes.
- Respond to requests for routes that do not exist (e.g., generate "404" errors).
- Handle exceptions that occur during route handler processing (e.g., generate "500" series errors).

## Updating the `req` Object
We can update the `req` object in our middleware to include additional properties. For example, adding a `log` property:
```js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  let loggedItem = `Request from: ${req.get('user-agent')} [${new Date()}]`;
  console.log(loggedItem);
  req.log = loggedItem;
  next();
});

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send(`Hello - ${req.log}`);
});
```
> Here, the middleware logs the request and adds a `log` property to the `req` object, which is then used in the route handler.

<br />

## Restricting Route Access
Middleware can be used to restrict access to specific routes:
```js
function randomDeny(req, res, next) {
  let allowed = Math.floor(Math.random() * 2); // 0 or 1
  if (allowed) {
    next();
  } else {
    res.status(403).send('Access Denied');
  }
}

app.get('/secure', randomDeny, (req, res) => {
  res.send('Welcome!');
});
```
> This middleware randomly allows or denies access to the `/secure` route. If denied, it sends a "403 Forbidden" response.

<br />

## Handling 404 Errors
We can create a custom "404" error to handle requests for unknown routes:
```js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.status(404).send("404 - We're unable to find what you're looking for.");
});
```
> This middleware is placed after all other route handlers to ensure it only executes if no other route matches, sending a "404 Not Found" response.

<br />

## Types of Middleware

### Application-Level Middleware
Application-level middleware is bound to your entire application and runs with every request or only when matching a specified route.
```js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Application-level middleware');
  next();
});
```

### Router-Level Middleware
Router-level middleware works the same way as application-level middleware but is attached to a specific router instance:
```js
const userRouter = express.Router();

userRouter.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('userRouter Middleware!');
  next();
});
```

### Error-Handling Middleware
Error-handling middleware is defined with four parameters `(err, req, res, next)` and is used for handling errors in the application:
```js
app.get('/error-test', (req, res) => {
  throw new Error('Error Test');
});

app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  res.status(500).send(`500 - ${err.message}`);
});
```

## Built-In Middleware
Express provides built-in middleware functions for common tasks:
```js
app.use(express.static('public')); // Serve static files

app.use(express.json()); // Parse JSON payloads

app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true })); // Parse URL-encoded data
```
