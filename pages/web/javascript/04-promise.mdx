# Promise

## Callback Review
- Callbacks are a traditional way to manage asynchronous code but can lead to callback hell with nested functions.

```javascript
function fetchData(callback) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        callback("Data received");
    }, 1000);
}

fetchData((data) => {
    console.log(data);
});
```
> The `fetchData` function simulates fetching data with a delay and then calls the provided callback function with the data. As more asynchronous operations are nested, this can lead to "callback hell."

<br />

## Introducing Promises
- Promises provide a cleaner and more structured way to handle asynchronous operations by chaining then and catch methods.

```javascript
const fetchData = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        resolve("Data received");
    }, 1000);
});

fetchData.then((data) => {
    console.log(data);
}).catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
});
```
> The example shows a `Promise` that resolves after a delay. The `.then` method handles the resolved value, and `.catch` handles any errors. This approach avoids deeply nested callbacks and makes the code more readable.

<br />

## Chaining Promises
- Chaining promises ensures that asynchronous tasks are executed in the correct order and errors are handled gracefully.

```javascript
const fetchData = () => new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        resolve("Data received");
    }, 1000);
});

fetchData()
    .then((data) => {
        console.log(data);
        return "Next task";
    })
    .then((nextTask) => {
        console.log(nextTask);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        console.error(error);
    });
```
> This example shows how promises can be chained to execute tasks sequentially. The first `.then` handles the initial promise, and the second `.then` handles the subsequent task. Errors in any part of the chain are caught by `.catch`.

<br />

## Error Handling
- Error handling is essential in asynchronous code to prevent unexpected behavior and ensure proper flow of execution.
- Promises allow for centralized error handling using the `.catch` method at the end of the chain.

```javascript
const fetchData = () => new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        reject("Error occurred");
    }, 1000);
});

fetchData()
    .then((data) => {
        console.log(data);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        console.error(error);
    });
```
> The `.catch` method ensures that any errors are handled properly, preventing the application from crashing unexpectedly.

<br />

## Async/Await
- Async/await simplifies asynchronous programming by allowing developers to write asynchronous code in a synchronous style, making it easier to read and maintain.

```javascript
const fetchData = () => new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        resolve("Data received");
    }, 1000);
});

async function getData() {
    const data = await fetchData();
    console.log(data);
}

getData();
```
> The `async` function `getData` uses `await` to pause execution until `fetchData` resolves. This approach makes asynchronous code look and behave more like synchronous code, enhancing readability and maintainability.

<br />

## Context of Promises with Async/Await
- Understanding how to use async/await within the context of promises is crucial for effective asynchronous programming in JavaScript.

```javascript
const fetchData = (isError) => new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        if (isError) {
            reject("Error occurred");
        } else {
            resolve("Data received");
        }
    }, 1000);
});

async function getData() {
    try {
        const data = await fetchData(false);
        console.log(data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
    }
}

getData();
```
> This example shows how `async`/`await` is used in conjunction with promises. The `try...catch` block handles any errors that occur during the asynchronous operation, demonstrating effective error handling within an `async` function.
