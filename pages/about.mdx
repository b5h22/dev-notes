I'm passionate about becoming a data-driven software developer. My goal is to integrate data-driven insights into software development to drive better decision-making in the company, improve the customer experience, and develop even stronger products and services. Beyond that, I'm also excited about applying data techniques to help tackle social challenges. Leveraging the power of data to make the world a better place is a big goal of mine.

Although my technical foundation is still developing, my dedication and fast learning capabilities are demonstrated by my 4.0 GPA, my personal blog documenting my learning journey, and various side projects beyond my coursework. My experience managing over 20 projects in the construction industry has refined my teamwork, time management, and adaptability skills, which are crucial in a dynamic and fast-paced environment.

To achieve this, I am continuously expanding my skills in data analysis and learning how to apply them in software development. I'm eager to collaborate with experts across different domains and find ways to amplify the positive impact that data can have on business and society. It's all about taking that deep understanding of data and translating it into real-world solutions that make a difference. That kind of work motivates me, and I can't wait to dive in more.
