You have a question (condition) and many choices (cases). If your question matches 'choice1', you will do something. If it matches 'choice2', you will do something else.

If it's true, it uses the first expression, and if it's false, it uses the second. Only the expression that matches the condition is used.\n// Example\nint a = 10, b = 20;\nint max = (a > b) ? a : b;\nIn this example, (a > b) is the condition. If a is greater than b, the expression a is used, and max becomes a. If a is not greater than b, the expression b is used, and max becomes b. Since 20 is greater than 10, in this case, max would become 20.","iteration-constructs#Iteration constructs":"In C programming, there are three ways to repeat actions: 'while', 'do while', and 'for'.
